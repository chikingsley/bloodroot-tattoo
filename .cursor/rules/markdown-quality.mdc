# Markdown Quality Standards

When creating or editing markdown files, follow these formatting rules to ensure clean, consistent documentation that passes markdown linting:

## Heading Rules (MD022)

- **ALWAYS** surround headings with blank lines above and below
- **NEVER** place content immediately after a heading without a blank line

```markdown
# Good Example

Content here...

## Another Heading  

More content...
```

```markdown
# Bad Example
Content immediately after heading (wrong!)

## Another Heading
More content without space above (wrong!)
```

## List Formatting (MD032)

- **ALWAYS** surround lists with blank lines before and after
- This applies to both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet) lists

```markdown
Some paragraph text.

- List item 1
- List item 2  
- List item 3

Next paragraph after the list.
```

## Code Block Requirements (MD040, MD031)

- **ALWAYS** specify a language for fenced code blocks
- **ALWAYS** surround code blocks with blank lines

```markdown
Here's some explanation.

```bash
# Good: language specified and surrounded by blank lines
npm install
```

More text continues here.
```

**NEVER** do this:
```markdown
```
# Bad: no language specified
```

## File Endings (MD047, MD009)

- **ALWAYS** end files with exactly one newline character
- **NEVER** leave trailing spaces at the end of lines
- Use exactly 2 spaces for line breaks in markdown, or 0 spaces

## Line Length (MD013) - IGNORED

- Line length checking is disabled for this project
- Feel free to write longer lines when needed for readability
- Focus on content clarity over arbitrary length limits

## Duplicate Headings (MD024)

- **AVOID** duplicate heading text within the same document
- Use descriptive, unique headings
- Add context to differentiate similar headings when needed

## Practical Examples

### Proper Document Structure:

```markdown
# Main Title

Brief introduction paragraph.

## Section Heading

Some content here.

### Subsection

More detailed content.

- List item with proper spacing
- Another list item

```bash
# Code example with language
npm run build
```

Final paragraph.
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

1. **Missing blank lines around headings**
2. **Missing blank lines around lists** 
3. **Code blocks without language specification**
4. **Missing blank lines around code blocks**
5. **Trailing whitespace**
6. **Missing final newline**

## When Writing Documentation:

- Start with proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Use blank lines generously for visual separation
- Always specify code block languages (`bash`, `javascript`, `json`, etc.)
- End files with a single newline
- Remove trailing spaces from all lines

Following these rules ensures consistent, professional documentation that passes all markdown linting checks.
